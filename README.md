### Summary 
This Expense Tracker was quite the journey for me. Using previous concepts and applying them to a table form, and having the cells update with each submit, as well as providing a delete button that deletes only the specific table row. Loved seeing this through, and so happy how the code turned out. Look forward to seeing you on the next project, and the self & professional discovery that will accompany it!


### Demonstrates

- Java onClick functions
